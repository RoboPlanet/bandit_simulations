# Bandit_simulations
Bandit algorithms simulations and analysis for online learning

This repo is part of my interest to learn more about optimisation for online learning algorithms which is heavily centerd on bandit theory. 

Analysis includes:
- [Epsilon Greedy](https://github.com/kfoofw/bandit_simulations/blob/master/analysis/eps-greedy.md)
- UCB (in future)
- Thompson Sampling
- Contextual Bandits

## Software
Python is used for the processing, with packages such as Pandas, Numpy and Altair. 

A possible future inclusion may be the [Vowpal Wabbit package](https://vowpalwabbit.org/) by Microsoft for the topic on Contextual Bandits.

## Special Mention
A portion of the code is based on the book ["Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/bandit-algorithms-for/9781449341565/) by John Myles White.
